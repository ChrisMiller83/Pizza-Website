# Pizza-Website
Building a website from scratch to order pizza
I started with a blank html and began adding a nav bar, drop down menus, checkboxes, and text boxes.
Next, I added images of pizza and a background, then styled them with css.
I added pages to link to in my nav bar.
We then learned about form validation.




As I continue to learn new skills I will add them to my website.
